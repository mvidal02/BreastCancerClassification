# Deep learning examples for Cancer Analysis

Here you can find two examples for the main inputs data in cancer analysis (images and genomics). These implementations are in pytorch and you can train and run it on both CPU as well as GPU.

The first example for image classification is using the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis) [[1]](#1). This dataset has 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue from 82 patients. 
The image collection was using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X and 400X) and has available images from malignant and non-malignant samples.
